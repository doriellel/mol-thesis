2302.00763_1785697_6	We present a set of tasks that require reasoning, test this system's ability to generalize zero-shot and investigate failure cases, and demonstrate how components of this system can be trained with reinforcement-learning to improve performance.
2302.02065_1786999_0	  In this work, the uplink channel estimation problem is considered for a millimeter wave (mmWave) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system.
2302.03774_1788708_0	  Significant enthusiasm around AI uptake has been witnessed across societies globally.
2302.04110_1789044_3	Arguments in support of the idea that regulation stifles innovation are analysed and criticised, and an alternative point of view is offered, showing how regulation and standards can foster innovation in the field of AI.
2302.04603_1789537_5	The resulting data is analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis to identify the main challenges facing the implementation of contestability in public AI.
2302.04844_1789778_4	Diverse and multidisciplinary perspectives are needed to examine and mitigate risk in generative AI systems from conception to deployment.
2302.06034_1790968_1	RE for AI practices have not been studied much and have scarce empirical studies.
2302.06476_1791410_2	However, it is not yet known whether ChatGPT can serve as a generalist model that can perform many NLP tasks zero-shot.
2302.06609_1791543_1	Their demands and requirements for AI explainability are not incorporated into the design and evaluation of XAI techniques, which are developed to explain the rationales of AI decisions to end-users and assist their critical decisions.
2302.06975_1791909_4	This review aims to provide the reader with an overview of causal methods that have been developed to improve the trustworthiness of AI models.
2302.08579_1793513_2	To alleviate this problem, this paper designs a replaceable internal language model (RILM) method, which makes it feasible to directly replace the internal language model (LM) of E2E ASR models with a target-domain LM in the decoding stage when a domain shift is encountered.
2302.08807_1793741_5	We find that although the voice of AI is considered valuable, AI still plays a secondary role in the group because it cannot fully follow the dynamics of the discussion and make progressive contributions.
2302.09487_1794421_0	  The use of AI in healthcare is designed to improve care delivery and augment the decisions of providers to enhance patient outcomes.
2302.10294_1795228_6	As a baseline model, large eddy simulations (LES) are carried out using the discontinuous Galerkin flow solver FLEXI.
2302.10816_1795750_2	In this paper, we argue that RE should not only be carefully conducted but also tailored for Responsible AI.
2302.11957_1796891_2	However, it is not yet known whether LLMs can be served as a high-quality sentence simplification system.
2302.12246_1797180_1	It is known that the effective design of task-specific prompts is critical for LLMs' ability to produce high-quality answers.
2302.13142_1798076_7	Control development and validations were conducted on two fuel cell system (FCS) models, a nonlinear open-source model and a proprietary Ford high-fidelity model
2302.14229_1799163_2	However, it is not yet known the performance of LLMs on CLS.
2302.14360_1799294_3	The study findings suggest that users are comfortable with AI systems if they have control and their privacy is not affected.
