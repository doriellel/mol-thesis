acl_12_34879_2	When a digit is read or generated by a causal language model it does not know its place value (e.g. thousands vs. hundreds) until the entire number is processed.	a causal language model	model	read,generate
acl_acl_126_36901_4	It is determined by counting the revision edits generated by LLMs.	LLMs	LLM	generate
acl_19_45086_1	Therefore, determining whether a text was generated by an LLM has become one of the factors that must be considered when evaluating its reliability.	an LLM	LLM	generate
acl_14_32176_3	Extensive experiments are conducted on Causal Question Answering (CQA), where IBE-Eval is tasked to select the most plausible causal explanation amongst competing ones generated by LLMs (i.e., GPT 3.5 and Llama 2).	LLMs	LLM	generate
arx_1910.12591_1196510_3	Having a better understanding of those conventions guiding the advances in AI is considered as the first and required advance to understand the conventions afterwards reflected by those autonomous systems in the interactions with societies.	those autonomous systems	system	reflect
arx_2002.10965_1248388_3	For the sake of simplicity, a simple single-cell scenario is considered, where the optimization of the BS and IRS phase shifts is solved by a low-complexity trellis-based algorithm.	a low-complexity trellis-based algorithm	algorithm	solve
arx_0906.5497_132048_3	We find that the observed behaviour is explained by a model including the effects associated with the variations of pressure and density.	a model	model	explain
