arx_2302.05733_1790667_5	In particular, we show that instruction-following LLMs can produce targeted malicious content, including hate speech and scams, bypassing in-the-wild defenses implemented by LLM API vendors.	instruction-following LLMs	LLM	produce
2304.02210_1820256_0	  Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can produce coherent, cohesive, relevant, and fluent answers for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.	  Large language models (LLMs)  	  model	  produce
ac_586_6176_1	While prior research focused on morphosyntactic, semantic, and world knowledge, it remains unclear to which extent LMs also derive lexical type-level knowledge from words in context.	LMs	LM	derive
