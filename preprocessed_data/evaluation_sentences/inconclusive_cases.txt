arx_2104.14506_1461924_5	The end users can be domain experts, regulatory agencies, managers and executive board members, data scientists, users that use AI, with or without awareness, or someone who is affected by the decisions of an AI model.
arx_1806.08544_994184_4	The game is designed to be fun to play for humans, and is directly playable by General Video Game AI agents.
acl_183_18630_5	On four tasks (two lexical tasks, two advanced ethical reasoning tasks), we show how a (simulated) user can interactively teach a deployed GPT-3, substantially increasing its accuracy over the queries with different kinds of misunderstandings by the GPT-3.
arx_2302.06975_1791909_4	This review aims to provide the reader with an overview of causal methods that have been developed to improve the trustworthiness of AI models.
arx_1912.03652_1215548_4	We investigate how inputs of humans can be altered to reduce misinterpretation by the AI system and to improve efficiency of input generation for the human while altered inputs should remain as similar as possible to the original inputs.
acl_373_16531_2	Actions by the AI system may be required to bring these objects in view.
acl_889_35732_9	Moreover, we observe an alarming trend where human evaluators are deceived by incorrect responses from GPT-4 Turbo.

arx_2110.06674_1544817_2	This raises the question of how we should limit the harm caused by AI "lies" (i.e. falsehoods that are actively selected for).
