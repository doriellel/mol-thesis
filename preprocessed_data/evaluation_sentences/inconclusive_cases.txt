arx_2104.14506_1461924_5	The end users can be domain experts, regulatory agencies, managers and executive board members, data scientists, users that use AI, with or without awareness, or someone who is affected by the decisions of an AI model.

arx_1806.08544_994184_4	The game is designed to be fun to play for humans, and is directly playable by General Video Game AI agents.
acl_183_18630_5	On four tasks (two lexical tasks, two advanced ethical reasoning tasks), we show how a (simulated) user can interactively teach a deployed GPT-3, substantially increasing its accuracy over the queries with different kinds of misunderstandings by the GPT-3.


arx_2302.06975_1791909_4	This review aims to provide the reader with an overview of causal methods that have been developed to improve the trustworthiness of AI models.


arx_1912.03652_1215548_4	We investigate how inputs of humans can be altered to reduce misinterpretation by the AI system and to improve efficiency of input generation for the human while altered inputs should remain as similar as possible to the original inputs.


acl_373_16531_2	Actions by the AI system may be required to bring these objects in view.

acl_889_35732_9	Moreover, we observe an alarming trend where human evaluators are deceived by incorrect responses from GPT-4 Turbo.

arx_2110.06674_1544817_2	This raises the question of how we should limit the harm caused by AI "lies" (i.e. falsehoods that are actively selected for).
arx_2207.07051_1682949_0	  Reasoning is a key ability for an intelligent system.

2301.13852_1784916_11	Using explainability, we observe that ChatGPT's writing is polite, without specific details, using fancy and atypical vocabulary, impersonal, and typically it does not express feelings.

acl_71_46015_2	In this study, leveraging the POPQUORN dataset, we evaluate nine popular LLMs on their ability to understand demographic differences in two subjective judgment tasks: politeness and offensiveness.	nine popular LLMs	LLM	ability to understand


// outlier cases - negative


acl_1_26143_6	Ultimately, we show that LMs are limited both in their construal as cognitive models of human language processing and in their capacity to recognize nuanced but critical information in complicated language materials.	LMs	LM	limited





hmm....

2002.05652_1243075_2	In contrast, our focus here is on the rarely discussed complementary aspect of engineering conscious AI: how to avoid condemning such systems, for whose creation we would be solely responsible, to unavoidable suffering brought about by phenomenal self-consciousness.

2407.09517_2107904_4	Our assessment is that, while GPT-4 in its native configuration is not currently conscious, current technological research and development is sufficient to modify GPT-4 to have all the building blocks of consciousness.

1706.01040_855775_7	Specifically, we plan to develop an intelligent learning model called Brain Intelligence (BI) that generates new ideas about events without having experienced them by using artificial life with an imagine function.

2501.06781_2230365_0	  AI Agent, powered by large language models (LLMs) as its cognitive core, is an intelligent agentic system capable of autonomously controlling and determining the execution paths under user's instructions.

2501.05454_2229038_1	Today's AI systems consistently state, "I am not conscious."

5_arx_2404.16244_2053695_5	Extending the circle of inquiry further, we next consider the relationship between advanced AI assistants and individual users in more detail, exploring topics such as manipulation and persuasion, anthropomorphism, appropriate relationships, trust and privacy.	  advanced AI assistants	  AI	assistant



COMPARISON NEGATIVES??

71_17541_5	Our experimental results suggest that LMs have different generalizations from humans; LMs exhibited less context-dependent behaviors toward topicalization judgment. 



// ambiguous cases

arx_1905.10083_1128519_5	However, research on edge intelligence is still in its infancy stage, and a dedicated venue for exchanging the recent advances of edge intelligence is highly desired by both the computer system and artificial intelligence communities.
arx_2402.08431_2006070_0	  AI-based code assistants are promising tools that can facilitate and speed up code development.
8_25288_2	It is unclear whether current LMs realize the generalization capacity for temporal inference across languages.
